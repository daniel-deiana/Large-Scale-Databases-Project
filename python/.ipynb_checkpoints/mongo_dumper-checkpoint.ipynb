This may sound like I'm placing the series on a pedestal, and you could say that personal bias has influenced by decision to rate MIA a full 10/10 for all the components, but please allow me to try my best to break down and pinpoint just exactly why it has earned such a place in my heart.  \\r\\n \\r\\nBeginning with the first episode, which took me by serious surprise when I was left in absolute awe by the mystical vibes exuded by the astounding visuals and the beautiful soundtrack. MIA has one of the best first episodes I have ever seen thus far because unlike other shows where they bombard the audience with a complex plot in a desperate attempt to bait them into watching the rest of the show, MIA does that exact opposite. Instead, we tag along with our protagonist, Riko, and her adventures down into the abyss. Some things occur, and right off the bat, episode one was sufficient to leave me tense at the edge of my seat, yet the premise is simple and digestible enough for me to follow along. And at the end, we are treated with a stunning picturesque overview of the abyss, and that alone was enough to leave me desiring to be transported into their world and explore the abyss along with Riko. They had successfully pulled off their intended effect – to reproduce that sort of charm and mystery of the abyss, something that is so dangerous, slightly sinister, yet people, both the characters in MIA, along with the audience, are drawn to it.  \\r\\n \\r\\nMoving on to the crux of MIA, the plot. The first few episodes mask the true sinister reality of the show and I was tricked into thinking this would be a cute adventure series with Riko and friends, but boy does that completely change in the next few episodes to come. Now don’t get me wrong, being ‘dark’ or ‘deep’ doesn’t necessarily equate to a good compelling story, as plenty of shows that seek to achieve such an effect often go beyond their capacity and all that remains is simply a cringefest of wasted potential. Yet, MIA absolutely nails in its execution. Even in earlier parts where there was a lighter more upbeat tone, the story never got stale and it was just downright entertaining to witness the happenings and adventures of Riko and those around her. And now that I think about it, it wasn’t really the plot itself that was unique or fantastic, rather, it's the perfect pacing and storytelling the series chose to adopt that really sold the show to me. I would go so far as to say that MIA is somewhat like a deconstruction of adventure genres and how behind the excitement and thrill of going on a journey of never return, lies the harsh brutal reality, something that even 12 years olds are not immune to, and are in fact more prone to its effects due to their fragility.  \\r\\n \\r\\nI could not have asked for a better two main characters, Riko and Reg. One is an enthusiastic fearless adventurer and the other a shy yet fiercely protective friend. This iconic pair are extremely well written characters that spoke out to me on a profound level, weaving my emotional attachment towards them, and thus cue the tears and heartache when misfortune befell them. The complement and supplement each other in so many ways that it is just really darn endearing to see them interact. And due to spoiler reasons, I shall not delve deep into the third main character that only appears in the later episodes, but she, too, is absolutely precious and I honestly cherish the chemistry and relationships that they foster over the span of the series. Even side characters, including the most minor ones, and even ones that don’t even appear apart from through flashbacks and recollections, are memorable and they have that sense of quirkiness and originality that is in its own way a breath of fresh air after so many reused anime troupes that we have seen time and time again.  \\r\\n \\r\\nEvery single Friday for 13 weeks, this show was something that I really looked forward to. It was a spectacular journey and one that I am so happy I decided to start. It is absolutely magical and a feast for my eyes as with such a unique art style accompanied with the most detailed backgrounds. Every piece of music matched the scene so well and it was truly a beautiful symphony of sounds, visuals and storytelling. Thank you for reading my review of this Masterpiece and I hope that you will embark on the same journey as me and finish it with the same feelings as I did. :)  \\r\\n\\n\\n          \\n \\n       Helpful \\n   \\n      \",\n",

Character development for the 3 main meisters was well paced and it was really heartwarming to see them grow and develop over the course of the anime.  \\r\\n \\r\\nOne of the things I would like to point out is that Soul Eater will be one hell of a emotional rollercoaster ride. I\\'m not certain if it\\'s because I got too invested into the characters and hence over empathising with them, but even if that\\'s the case it means that the show had done a good job with character engagement with the audience. The show starts out slow, with an episodic style with minimal continuation, but still enough suspense to keep you coming back for more. Every episode seems to hint at something, and you feel something build up as the episodes progress, and its that subtle feeling that trouble is brewing that really hooked me into Soul Eater. Weirdly enough, this anime had a fair share of really emotional angst scenes even though its a comedy genre. This is what turned some people off in the later episodes, but personally I could use some angst so I was sucked deeper into this series (lol). But if you\\'re a fan of comedies, then this show is a must watch because the antics of BlackStar and Soul Eater are HILARIOUS and will have you laughing at how silly everything is. The pacing in this anime was perfect for me (and apart from the two really annoying filler episodes of Excalibur) all the episodes were deeply enjoyable and satisfied me.  \\r\\n \\r\\nNow on to the art. I really really liked the art style. It was simple and easy to set your eyes on, and it felt fresh. The action sequences were also a feast for my eyes with a variety of fights varying from sword fights, hand on hand combat and guns. The soundtrack for this series is also something different from your usual soundtrack, with most songs having English lyrics and being pop, and the change to a sadder music when the time required it, every piece of music really suited the scenes and it just flows so well you won\\'t even realise that the music really played such a huge part.  \\r\\n \\r\\nIf you have been reading other reviews, you would have come across people saying they were disappointed by the ending, or by the second half of the series when things got more serious. If you have not read the manga, then it the ending isn\\'t really that bad, maybe you might consider it slightly underwhelming, but for me it was perfect.  \\r\\n \\r\\nAnother thing I want to add, is that this show actually cleverly dealt with many of the internal conflicts and struggles that we have within us. With the main enemy of the show being \"the madness that lies within us all\", and how we fight it every day so that we\\'re not overtaken by it. It was really beautiful, and the dialogues in Soul Eater were written really well, and there are takeaways in this anime that resulted in my emotional stir at the very end of the last episode.  \\r\\n \\r\\nI hope you will enjoy Soul Eater as much as I did.

I started watching this anime because of two reasons, 1. The ratings were too good to be true; 2. I like time-travelling and scifi genres. So to begin I was already harbouring high expectations for this anime.  \\r\\n \\r\\nI had read somewhere that the first few episodes were more sliceoflife typed rather than thriller, and true enough, in the first few episodes we are introduced to the various characters, and we learn about their antics, their behaviours, and them as a whole. The character development in Steins;Gate is beautifully done and unlike half-assed supporting characters, we are rewarded with well-designed and realistic character personality and premises that make each and everyone of them unique and essential in bringing this anime to life.  \\r\\n \\r\\nWhen watching the first few episodes, you may feel like giving up because the story is admittedly slightly boring at the beginning, adopting a slower pace without much sci-fi and thriller that we all came looking for when we decided to watch this anime. HOWEVER, DO NOT STOP WATCHING. I cannot repeat this enough. Your patience will be rewarded at the end and things only get better and better.  \\r\\n \\r\\nSteins;Gate is one of the few shows that have managed to blow my mind away with its amazing, detailed and well-planned storyline that makes you go EUREKA I UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING NOW with just a single revelation at the very end. It does this magic where it doesn\\'t straight out tell you in exposition, but it reveals it in a way where you are involved first-handedly and you experience the same emotions the characters are going through.  \\r\\n \\r\\nNow being a fanatic over this whole concept of time travelling, I\\'m not easily satisfied with just another time travel story that\\'s plot is most often overused, confusing, contradictory and straight out poorly executed. BUT Steins;Gate has done this brilliant feat whereby it has set fixed rules about the way time works on its world and how things are affected by it. Additionally, the story was quoted to be \"99% science and 1% fiction\" and it is true to a large extent because the theories used in Steins\\'Gate are backed by actual theories that are widely believed in the science world. This anime also reminds me of the movie Interstellar, so if you enjoy Interstellar, you will enjoy this too.  \\r\\n \\r\\n(slight spoilers) \\r\\nFinally, although this isn\\'t a romance genre anime, a beautiful tragic love story is smartly masked under the façade of a sci-fi movie. The relationships and interactions between okabe, mayuri and kurisu is done so well that you can\\'t help but be pained by the circumstances that okabe has to go through.  \\r\\n \\r\\nOverall, YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS ANIME.\\n\\n          \\n \\n       Helpful \\n   \\n      ',\n",

That\\'s because ngnl zero is a completely different story from the one we were all familiar with, the lighthearted, playful story with one of the brightest most colourful palette in anime history. Instead, its frankly quite the opposite, and I absolutely enjoyed it.  \\r\\n \\r\\nNgnl zero sheds a different light onto this fantasy world of disboard, and delves into the sacrifices and hardship some had to go through to achieve the current \"utopia\" that Sora and Shiro live in. The movie has a distinctly different feel and vibe to it despite the same art style and very similar looking characters with the same voices. And contrary to the series, it takes itself very seriously and will touch your heart in one way or another, and perhaps you will shed a tear or two, which I did in my case.  \\r\\n \\r\\nPlotwise, however, the movie may have suffered due to a rush pacing or a not so smooth adaptation from the original light novel (disclaimer: I have not read any of the novels). There were many parts where I wished they spent more time going into the details of it rather than just rushing through, spamming the audience with complicated names and numbers introduced as quickly as they disappeared. This movie does not have the most logical, unique or mindblowing plot and will not satisfy you the way the series did with its clever tactics and counterattacking measures. The uneven pacing left me with a confused expression plastered on my face as what little explanation(mostly done through exposition) that the movie threw to me I wasn\\'t able to grasp completely, and that deeply irritated me because it felt like I was shortchanging myself on the movie experience. But upon completion of the movie, it struck me that it didn\\'t matter if certain details were unclear or left out, because that wasn\\'t the point of the show. And it did happen 6000 years ago so really, the details of execution of plans shouldn\\'t be the crux of the story, but rather the heart and emotions behind it. And to me that was done really well.  \\r\\n \\r\\nNow on to why YOU MUST WATCH THE MOVIE. The visuals...they were so beautiful, although literally blinding at some times, unfortunately. But Madhouse really did a fantastic job with the crazy amount of details they put into every single background and the smooth fluid animation in the fight sequences. It was a feast for the eyes and I was happy to see that they toned down on the colour spasm and made it into something more subtle but still incredibly breathtaking. The music and sounds were also phenomenal with many dramatic silences that led up to emotional pitfalls for the audience ;_; (if you know what I\\'m taking about). I watched this movie in the cinemas and it was worth every cent with the huge screen and blasting music it was great.  \\r\\n \\r\\nNgnl zero isn\\'t a masterpiece movie that will change your life or anything. It\\'s far from that really. But it can\\'t be taken as a stand alone. It is a prequel and a side story of sorts to supplement the main story and I think it has done an incredible job at fulfilling its aim :) \\n\\n          \\n \\n       Helpful \\n   \\n      ',\n",

Well that's what I had thought too but Gamers! is really just about gamers and their crazy daily antics. I was expecting a show revolving around some gaming club, but I was rewarded with an extremely amusing love pentagon and honestly, I'm not complaining ;)  \\r\\n \\r\\nThe main catch of Gamers!, I personally feel, is how relatable it is. What I initially thought of as a boring cast of highschool students slowly grew on me as we delve deeper into their personal lives and how their world functions and how they were shaped into the way they are now. Each character is unique and quirky in their own way that it made the show so enjoyable!   \\r\\n \\r\\nAnd now moving on to the crux of the show, the romcom aspects. Honestly this is the dumbest and yet entertaining romcom I've seen. It does go in horrifying circles and while that tends to leave me frustrated and annoyed at such dragged out plot, Gamers! absolutely nails in its execution because of how well the dynamic of the characters' relationship with one another have been established, and thus crafting the platform for hilarious scenarios. Each character is given decent screentime and through their lens, we get to see how they view the wacky situation at hand and we laugh at their overthinking, their misunderstandings, and their foolishness.  \\r\\n \\r\\nOverall, Gamers! is definitely a show to check out if you desire something light hearted and fun :>\\n\\n          \\n \\n       Helpful \\n   \\n      \",\n",
